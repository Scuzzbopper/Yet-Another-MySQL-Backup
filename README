Yet Another MySQL Backup
=======================

*under construction*

(I am fully aware that this code is in a crappy stage and that it is public, but I am counting that no one will see it anyway)

What this script does?
=====================

Takes a full physical backup (actual files) using xtrabackup/innobackupex
Sets it up to be quickly restored from
Deletes physical backups older then 2 days old

Takes a full logical backup (SQL statements) using MyDumper
with seperate compressed files (MyLoader understands these compressedfiles)
Deletes logical backups older then 7 days

Emails if there is an error with either backup methods

Emails a report at the end of backup with metadata about the backups
as well as slave information (assumes you are backing up from a slave).

Lightly sprinkled error handling.
 
Assumptions:
===========
A lot..
You have the percona repository installed with xtrabackup and percona-toolkit
You have MyDumper
You have configured your own ~/.my.cnf file with your MySQL username and password
You have sendmail and mutt email applications installed on your server.
You understand BASH enough to go over the code and make the changes you need for it to work on your own server (it's not that hard.. I'm not that great anyway).
